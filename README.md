Goodfeelin is a simple music player where users are able to play a chillhop playlist. This project uses the HTML5 audio API to include play/pause functionality along with JavaScript event listeners to switch songs and display the progress bar on the DOM. The goal of this project was to learn how to use the HTML5 audio API along with JavaScript to add music player functionality such as play/pause, previous/next and changing the duration through the progress bar.
